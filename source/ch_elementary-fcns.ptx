  <title>Elementary Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      How should complex-valued functions such as <m>e^z</m>,
      <m>\log z</m>, <m>\sin z</m>, and the like, be defined?
      Clearly, any responsible definition should satisfy the following criteria.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The functions so defined must give the same values as the corresponding functions for real variables when the number <m>z</m> is a real number.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            As much as possible,
            the properties of these new functions must correspond with their real counterparts.
            For example, we would want
            <m>e^{z_1+z_2}=e^{z_1}e^{z_2}</m> to be valid regardless of whether <m>z</m> were real or complex.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These requirements may seem like a tall order to fill.
      There is a procedure, however,
      that offers promising results.
      It is to put the expansion of the real functions <m>e^x</m>,
      <m>\sin x</m>, and so on, as power series in complex form.
      We use this strategy in this chapter.
