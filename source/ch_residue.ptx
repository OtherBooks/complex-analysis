  <title>Residue Theory</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We now have the necessary machinery to see some amazing applications of the tools we developed in the last few chapters.
      You will how Laurent expansions can give useful information concerning seemingly unrelated properties of complex functions.
      You will also learn how the ideas of complex analysis make the solution of very complicated integrals of real-valued functions as easy<ndash/>literally<ndash/>as the computation of residues.
      We begin with a theorem relating residues to the evaluation of complex integrals
